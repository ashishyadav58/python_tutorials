# Variables & Datatypes

## Variables
Variables: A variable is a named storage location that can hold a value. In Python, you can create a variable by assigning a value to it, like this:

x = 5

In this example, "x" is a variable that holds the value 5.

## Rules for defining a variable name
1. A variable name can contain alphabets, digits and underscore
2. A variable name only starts with an alphabets and underscore
3. A variable name can't start with a digits
4. No while space is allowed to be used inside a variable name

## Reserved Keywords
Keywords: Keywords are special reserved words that have a specific meaning in Python. They are used to define the structure of your program and cannot be used as variable names. Some examples of keywords in Python are "if", "for", "while", and "import".

## Identifiers
Identifiers: Identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, and other objects in Python. They can be any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number or contain spaces. For example, "my_variable" is a valid identifier in Python.

It's important to understand these concepts when writing Python code, as they form the foundation of the language and help you organize and structure your programs.
