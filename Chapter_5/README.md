# Input Function In Python

The input function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to accept input from the user of your program. Here's an example:

```bash
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

This code will prompt the user to enter their name, and then print a personalized greeting. When you run the program, it will look like this:

```bash
What is your name? John
Hello, John
```

That's a basic example of the input function in action! It's a powerful tool for creating interactive programs that can accept and respond to user input. You can also use it to accept input of different data types, like numbers or booleans.

### Handling Different Data Types:
Let's see an example in which we are taking input of user age in number and converting inputed data type from string to integer.

```bash
user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("Your Age:", user_age")
```

### Input in Real-Life Examples:

Let's make a simple two number addtion program

```bash
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
result = num1 + num2
print("Result:", result)
```
