# Operators In Python
### Following are some common operators in python.

1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, etc.
2. Assigment Operators: =, +=, -=, etc.
3. Comparisor Operators: ==, >, <, >=, <=, !=, etc.
4. Logical Operators: and, or, not

### Operators Precedence & Associativity

| Opearators | Description | associativity |
| :-------- | :------- | :------- |
| () | Parenthese| Left to Right |
| ** | Exponent | Right to Left |
| +X, -X, ~X | Unary Plus, Unary Minus, Bitwise Not | Right to Left |
| *, /, //, % | Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus| Left to Right |
| +, - | Addition, Subtraction | Left to Right |
| <<, >> | Bitwise shift operators | Left to Right |
| & | Bitwise AND | Left to Right |
| ^ | Bitwise XOR | Left to Right |
| l | Bitwise OR | Left to Right |
| ==, !=, >, >=, <=, is, is not, in, not in | Comparisons, Identity, Membership operators | Left to Right |
| not | Logical NOT |
| or | Logical OR |
| and | Logical AND |
| =, +=, -=, *=, /= | Assignment Operator |

##

-> If you divide any variable value by 

```bash
a = 33
a /= 3

print(a)
```
Result: 11.0 (result in float)

### Python is a Case sensitive

```bash
a = 34
A = 30
```

So 'a' and 'A' is not same because the variable name is Case Sensitive.

### Logical Operators

'and' - Returns true when both are true.

'or' - Returns true when one of us is true.

'not' - Returns the opposite like if variable value is true then it returns false.
